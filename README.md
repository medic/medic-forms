Medic Mobile Form Definition Language
-------------------------------------

This repository contains a library for loading, validating, and rendering
data collection forms written in Medic Mobile's JSON-based form definition
language. The library supports nested subforms, repetition, validation
rules, conditional field display, and a large number of field types
targeted toward mobile data collection.

This repository is a work in progress, and should not be used in production.
