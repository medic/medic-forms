Medic Mobile Form Definition Language
=====================================

This package includes validation and normalization tools for Medic Mobile's
JSON-based form definition language. Validate and normalize form definitions,
then validate form submissions against a normalized form definition.

Supports nested subforms, repetition, validation rules, conditional field
display, and a large number of field types targeted toward mobile data
collection.

This repository is a work in progress, and should not be used in production.
